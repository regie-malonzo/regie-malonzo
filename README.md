Hi there ðŸ‘‹
* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects: one is a personal project called gym-progression-app, a web app where you can track your personal best (PB) from your gym workouts and visualize your progress on a line chart. The second one is a group project called Flight-Plan, which started during my time at Dev Academy. Itâ€™s a web app that lets you plan a trip with your friends so that all information isnâ€™t just kept by a single person.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use data from a database and implement it on a chart for my personal project. Additionally, I am exploring more APIs to use in our group project, Flight-Plan.
